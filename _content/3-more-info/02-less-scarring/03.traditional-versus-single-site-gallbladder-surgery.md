<p>Iâ€™m Dr. Jeffrey Eakin, a gastrointestinal surgeon at Jordan Valley Medical Center and the West Valley Campus.</p>
<p>How has gallbladder surgery changed over the years? For decades, traditional open surgery was used to remove the gallbladder and this approach left the patient with a large, painful scar. Laparoscopic surgery has been around for approximately 20 years, and enables the surgeon to remove the gallbladder through four small incisions. </p>
<p>In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a single-site, robotic-assisted procedure for gallbladder surgery, which is virtually scarless.</p>
