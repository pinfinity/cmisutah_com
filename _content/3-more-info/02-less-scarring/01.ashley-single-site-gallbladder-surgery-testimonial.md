<p>I am very pleased with the results of my gallbladder surgery.</p>
<p> 
Everyone was kind and attentive and my physician explained all parts of the single-site robotic gallbladder procedure.</p>
<p> 
The hospital staff helped with everything I needed before and after the procedure and I was able to go home only a short time after waking up.</p>
<p>
The tiny incision in my belly button is barely noticeable and feeling even better than I expected.</p>
<p>
My recovery time has been very quick with minimal pain.</p>
