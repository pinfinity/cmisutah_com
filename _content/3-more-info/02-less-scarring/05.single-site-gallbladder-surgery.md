<p>I’m Dr. Jeffrey Eakin, a gastrointestinal surgeon at Jordan Valley Medical Center and the West Valley Campus.</p>
<p>More than 1 million people in the U.S. have their gallbladder removed each year. Fortunately, Single Site robotic-assisted surgery provides the surgeon with the tools to relieve pain and get patients back to everyday life as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The procedure enables a surgeon to remove a diseased or infected gallbladder through the patient’s bellybutton. In comparison to traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries, Single Site patients typically experience less pain. </p>
<p>Scarring is almost undetectable because the surgery is performed through just one tiny incision in the bellybutton.</p>
