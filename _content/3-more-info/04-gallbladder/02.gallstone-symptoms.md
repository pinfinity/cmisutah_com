<p>Gallstones form in some people's gallbladders. When the gallbladder squeezes, a stone can get stuck in the opening of the gallbladder causing pain. </p>
<p>The stone can also get stuck in the main bile duct, blocking all the bile from draining into the intestine. This can cause jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, and put you at risk for a serious infection. </p>
<p>Other times, the stone can get stuck at the opening of a duct going to the pancreas. This can cause pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas. This causes severe central abdominal pain that can also be felt in the back. This can be a serious condition requiring hospitalization. </p>
